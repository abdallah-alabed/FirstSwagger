# Swagger File 
- Swagger helps users build, document, test and consume RESTful web services.

I created this swaggerfile <link ME> by hand as a first attempt to understand the structure of the swagger file and the rest api itself, this REST Api is from [Dummy Json](https://dummyjson.com/)
an open source api for testing and training.
